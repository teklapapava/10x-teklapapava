    <!-- Quest 2 – Calculate Sector Power
 Difficulty: Easy (2 pts)
Story
 The Grid’s power levels are hidden. You must compute the combined power of two sectors.
Objective
 Use arithmetic to sum two power readings and display the result.
Instructions
Name your file quest2.js


Define a variable sectorA with value 5


Define a variable sectorB with value 7


Define a constant totalPower as sectorA plus sectorB


Print the exact sentence
 Total power: 12


Acceptance Criteria
sectorA is defined as a variable with value 5


sectorB is defined as a variable with value 7


totalPower is defined as a constant with value 12


The console shows exactly:
 Total power: 12 -->

 <!-- Quest 4 – Directional Routing
 Difficulty: Easy (2 pts)
Story
 The Grid’s traffic must be directed along the X-axis. Decide your route based on coordinate.
Objective
 Use an if/else statement to determine and print the correct direction.
Instructions
Name your file quest4.js


Define a variable xCoordinate with value -3


If xCoordinate is less than 0, print the exact sentence
 Route: West
 Otherwise, print
 Route: East


Acceptance Criteria
xCoordinate is defined as a variable with value -3


The console shows exactly:
 Route: West -->
<!-- Quest 8 – Retry Strategy
 Difficulty: Easy (2 pts)
Story
 Network retries are limited. You must decide whether to continue retrying.
Objective
 Use a ternary expression to choose and display the retry status.
Instructions
Name your file quest8.js


Create a variable retryCount with value 2


Create a constant maxRetries with value 5


Create a constant status that uses retryCount < maxRetries ? Continue : Stop


Print the exact sentence
 Status: Continue


Acceptance Criteria
retryCount is defined as a variable with value 2


maxRetries is defined as a constant with value 5


status is defined as a constant using a ternary expression


The console shows exactly:
 Status: Continue

 -->

 <!-- Quest 7 – System Health Check
 Difficulty: Easy (2 pts)
Story
 The Grid’s CPU and memory modules report their status. You must verify overall system health.
Objective
 Combine two boolean statuses and report if the system is OK.
Instructions
Name your file quest7.js


Create a constant cpuStatus and assign it the value true


Create a constant memoryStatus and assign it the value true


Create a constant systemOk that uses logical AND between cpuStatus and memoryStatus


Print the exact sentence
 System OK: true


Acceptance Criteria
cpuStatus and memoryStatus are defined as constants with value true


systemOk is defined as a constant using logical AND of cpuStatus and memoryStatus


The console shows exactly:
 System OK: true

 -->

 <!-- Quest 3 – Verify Access Level
 Difficulty: Easy (2 pts)
Story
 Each intern has a clearance code. You must check if your code meets the minimum threshold.
Objective
 Compare your clearance level against the required level and report the result.
Instructions
Name your file quest3.js


Define a constant clearanceLevel with value 45


Define a constant requiredLevel with value 50


Evaluate whether clearanceLevel is greater than or equal to requiredLevel


Print the exact sentence
 Access granted: false


Acceptance Criteria
clearanceLevel is defined as a constant with value 45


requiredLevel is defined as a constant with value 50


The console shows exactly:
 Access granted: false
 -->
<!-- Quest 42 – Render Node List
 Difficulty: Medium (3 pts)
Story
 You must dynamically display the active node names in the UI.
Objective
 Use DOM manipulation and a loop to render list items.
Instructions
Name your file quest42.js


Assume an HTML page with an empty <ul id="nodeList"></ul>


Create a constant activeNodes set to ['nodeA', 'nodeB', 'nodeC']


Select the nodeList element


Loop over activeNodes and for each name:


Create an li element


Set its textContent to the node name


Append it to nodeList


Acceptance Criteria
The ul#nodeList contains exactly three <li> entries with texts:
 nodeA
 nodeB
 nodeC -->

 <!-- <ul id="nodeList"></ul> -->



<!-- Quest 40 – Delegate Alert Handlers
 Difficulty: Medium (3 pts)
Story
 Multiple buttons trigger the same grid alert. You must avoid duplicate code by using a callback.
Objective
 Attach event listeners via a shared handler function.
Instructions
Name your file quest40.js


Assume an HTML page with buttons having class alert-btn


Declare a function handleAlert that prints exactly Alert triggered


Select all alert-btn elements into a list


Loop over the list and attach click listeners that call handleAlert


Acceptance Criteria
handleAlert logs “Alert triggered”


All buttons with class alert-btn use the same handler


Clicking any alert-btn prints exactly:
 Alert triggered



 -->



<!-- Quest H9 – Node Catalog
 Difficulty: Hard (5 pts)

Story
 You need to catalog nodes by index and uppercase name for reporting.
Objective
 Use map with an arrow function and template literals to build an array of labels.
Instructions
Name your file questH9.js


Create a constant nodes = ['core', 'grid', 'relay']


Use map on nodes with (name, idx) => \${idx + 1}. ${name.toUpperCase()}`and store inlabels`


Print exactly:
Node list: 1. CORE, 2. GRID, 3. RELAY


Acceptance Criteria
labels equals ["1. CORE", "2. GRID", "3. RELAY"]


The console shows exactly:
Node list: 1. CORE, 2. GRID, 3. RELAY
