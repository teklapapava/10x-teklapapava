    <!-- 1. Pokémon Battle – Function Basics
Story:
Ash and Gary are having a fierce Pokémon battle. Pikachu and Charizard are facing off, but Ash isn’t sure who has the higher attack power. Can you help him decide which Pokémon is stronger?
Instructions:
Create a function compareAttack(pokemon1, attack1, pokemon2, attack2).
It should return:
"Pikachu is stronger!" if Pikachu has a higher attack.
"Charizard is stronger!" if Charizard has a higher attack.
Call the function with compareAttack("Pikachu", 55, "Charizard", 84). -->


<!-- 2. Hogwarts Spell Casting – Function Parameters
Story:
Hermione is dueling Draco Malfoy in a spell-casting battle. She needs a function to announce what spell she is casting. Help her write a function that properly declares her spell attacks!
Instructions:
Create a function castSpell(spell, wizard).
It should return "Wizard casts Spell!", e.g., "Hermione casts Expelliarmus!".
Call the function with "Expelliarmus", "Hermione". -->
<!-- 
3. One Piece Bounty Calculator – Return Values
Story:
Luffy just defeated a powerful enemy, and the World Government has increased his bounty! But he’s too busy eating meat to do the calculations. Can you help him figure out his new bounty?
Instructions:
Create a function calculateBounty(currentBounty, increase).
It should return the new bounty after the increase.
Call it with 1_500_000_000, 500_000_000 and log the result. -->


<!-- 4. Jedi Training – Default Parameters
Story:
Master Yoda is training young Padawans, but some of them don’t have assigned strength levels yet. He needs your help to set their default power level if they don’t provide one!
Instructions:
Create a function trainJedi(name, strength = 50).
Return "Jedi Name has Strength Power" (e.g., "Luke has 100 Power").
Call it with "Luke", 100 and "Rey" (without strength). -->



<!-- 5. Gollum’s Precious – String Manipulation
Story:
Gollum is obsessed with the One Ring and repeats “My precious” over and over. Write a function to make Gollum sound like his usual self!
Instructions:
Create a function gollumSays(phrase).
It should return the phrase three times, separated by "... ".
Call it with: "My precious" (output: "My precious... My precious... My precious..."). -->


<!-- 6. Super Mario Power-Up – Function Expressions
Story:
Mario has just found a mysterious Super Mushroom, and he feels his jumping power doubling! Write a function to calculate his new jump height after eating the mushroom.
Instructions:
Create a function expression powerUp that multiplies jumpHeight by 2.
Call powerUp(5) and log the result.

 <!-- 7. Naruto’s Shadow Clone Jutsu – Arrow Functions
 Story:
 Naruto is preparing for an intense battle, but he needs more shadow clones! The more chakra he uses, the more clones he creates. Can you write a function to calculate his clones?
 Instructions:
 Create an arrow function shadowClone(count) => count * 5.
 Call it with 10 (Output: "50 clones created!") -->
 

 <!-- 8. Sorting the Sorting Hat – Callback Functions
 Story:
 The Sorting Hat at Hogwarts is about to sort new students into their houses, but it needs a helper function to determine which house each student belongs to. The Sorting Hat is an old magical object, and instead of choosing houses itself, it calls a separate function (a callback function) to decide where each student goes.
 Your job is to help the Sorting Hat by passing in a function that assigns a student to a house.
 Instructions:
 Create a function sortStudent(name, callback).
 The function should log: "Sorting [name] into..." and then call callback().
 The callback function should return a random house ("Gryffindor", "Slytherin", "Ravenclaw", "Hufflepuff").
 Call sortStudent("Harry", () => "Gryffindor") and log the result.
 Hint:
 👉 Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. The Sorting Hat doesn’t decide the house itself but calls another function (a callback) to do so. -->


 <!-- 9. Infinity Gauntlet – Function Scope
 Story:
 Thanos is about to snap his fingers, but before he does, he needs to check if he has all six Infinity Stones. However, since he keeps his stones hidden inside a secret function, his assistants can’t access the stones directly!
 Your task is to write a function that holds the number of Infinity Stones inside it and allows another function inside it to access this number.
 Instructions:
 Create a function snapFingers().
 Inside snapFingers(), declare a variable stones = 6.
 Inside snapFingers(), define another function checkStones() that logs: "Thanos has 6 stones. The universe trembles!"
 Call checkStones() inside snapFingers() to verify the stones before snapping.
 Hint:
 👉 This exercise tests function scope: checkStones() should be able to access stones even though it’s declared inside another function. -->



<!--  10. Time-Turner – Function Hoisting
 Story:
 Hermione Granger accidentally used the Time-Turner incorrectly, causing a function to be called before it is even defined. Surprisingly, JavaScript allows this!
 Your task is to write a function, call it before it’s defined, and explain why JavaScript lets this happen.
 Instructions:
 Call the function first, before defining it.
 Define a function turnBackTime() that logs "Going back in time!".
 Explain why it still works (Hint: Function Hoisting).
 Hint:
 👉 JavaScript moves function declarations to the top of the file before executing code. This is called hoisting. -->


 <!-- 11. Batman’s Secret Identity – Function Closures
 Story:
 Gotham City’s criminals are desperately trying to uncover Batman’s true identity. But Bruce Wayne is smart—he has stored his identity inside a function closure, making it impossible to access unless called correctly.
 Your task is to create a function that hides Batman’s identity inside it and only reveals it when called properly.
 Instructions:
 Create a function batman().
 Inside batman(), create another function that returns "I am Batman!".
 Return the inner function from batman().
 Store the result of batman() in a variable and call it.
 Hint:
 👉 Closures allow functions to “remember” the variables from their parent function, even after the parent function has executed. -->


<!-- 12. The Enchanted Mirror – Higher-Order Functions
Story:
In a hidden chamber of a mystical castle, there is an Enchanted Mirror that speaks only in uppercase letters. The mirror allows visitors to ask one question, but it transforms their words before answering.
Your task is to write a higher-order function that takes a message and a transformation function, then applies the transformation before returning the mirror’s reply.
Instructions:
Write a function magicMirror(message, transformFunction).
Inside magicMirror(), apply the transformFunction to message.
Return:
"The mirror says: [transformed message]".
Call magicMirror("Will I be rich?", str => str.toUpperCase()).
Example Output:

💡 Hint: A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function. Here, magicMirror() allows different transformations to be applied to messages. -->
