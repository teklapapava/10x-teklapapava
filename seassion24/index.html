<!-- Coding Challenge #1 
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: 
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter). 

Your tasks: 
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables 
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions) 
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. 

Test data: 
Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall. 
Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall. -->



<!-- Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it. 

Your tasks: 
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!" 
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" 
Hint: Use an if/else statement -->


<!-- Coding Challenge #3 
There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy! 

Your tasks: 
1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below 
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score) 
3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. 
Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks 
4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy 

Test data: 
Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110 
Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123 
Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106 -->

<!-- Coding Challenge #4 
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%. 

Your tasks: 
1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!) 
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25” 

Test data: 
Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430 
Hints: 
To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2 
Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 -->

Age Categorizer is a simple program that calculates a person's age based on their birth year and classifies them into different life stages. 
 It evaluates the calculated age and returns one of the following categories:
Child/Teenager – age under 18


Adult – age between 18 and 59


Senior – age between 60 and 100
 If the age is invalid (negative or unrealistic), it will return "Invalid Age."


Create an ageCategorizer.js program that takes a birth year as input, calculates the age, and classifies the person into one of the categories. 

examples:

console.log(categorizeAge(1997));  // Age: 28, Adult
console.log(categorizeAge(2015));  // Age: 10, Child/Teenager -->



<!-- The Flea and the Ant
We all know the story (if someone doesn’t know it, message me privately, and I’ll tell you :D). In short, so that the ant doesn’t drown, its friend, the flea, goes to the pig to ask for a bristle, and this is where its adventure begins.
Conditions:
If the flea brings an acorn to the pig, then the pig will give a bristle. The flea goes to the oak to ask for an acorn.


If the flea removes the crow from the oak, then the oak will give an acorn. The flea goes to the crow and asks it to move away from the oak.


The crow says: if the flea brings a chick to the crow, then the crow will move away from the oak. The flea goes to the hen to ask for a chick.


If the flea brings millet to the hen, then it will give one chick. The flea goes to the pit to ask for millet.


If the flea removes the mouse from the pit, then it will give millet to the hen.


If the flea removes the cat from the mouse, then the mouse will move away from the pit.


If the flea brings milk to the cat, then it will move away from the mouse.


If the flea brings grass to the cow, then the cow will give milk to the cat.


The flea brings grass to the cow.
Fulfill all of the listed conditions, after which the pig will give fleas to the bristles.
Result: The flea braids a rope and pulls the ant out.

 Task: Matrix (2D Array) Multiplication Check
 Objective:
 Write a JavaScript function that checks whether two matrices can be multiplied. The function should return true if they can be multiplied and false otherwise.
 Matrix Multiplication Rule:
 Two matrices A and B can be multiplied if and only if the number of columns in matrix A is equal to the number of rows in matrix B.
 If matrix A has dimensions m × n (m rows, n columns)
 
 
 And matrix B has dimensions p × q (p rows, q columns)
 
 
 Then matrix multiplication A × B is possible if n == p; otherwise, it is not possible.
 
 
 Task Requirements:
 Write a function named canMultiplyMatrices(matrixA, matrixB).
 
 
 The function should take two 2D arrays (matrices) as arguments.
 
 
 It should return true if the matrices can be multiplied, otherwise return false.
 
 
 Assume that the input matrices are valid (i.e., each row has the same number of elements).
 Submission Instructions:
 Write your function in JavaScript and test it with different inputs.
 const A = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]];
 
 
 const B = [
   [7, 8],
   [9, 10],
   [11, 12]
 ];
 const C = [
   [1, 2],
   [3, 4]
 ];
 
 
 const D = [
   [5, 6, 7],
   [8, 9, 10]
 ];
 
 
 Submit your solution along with test cases. -->
