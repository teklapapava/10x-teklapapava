    <!-- Task 1: Basic Counting Loop (For Loop)
Story:
The evil sorcerer has trapped you in a dungeon with a magical countdown lock. To escape, you need to write a JavaScript function that counts down from n to 1. If you succeed, the lock will open, and you’ll be free!
Instructions:
Write a function countDownFrom(n) that prints numbers from n to 1 using a for loop.
Example:
countDownFrom(5); // Output: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -->



<!-- Task 2: Iterate Over an Array (For...of Loop)
Story:
You’re a chef preparing a fruit salad for a royal banquet. The king has given you a list of fruits, and you need to display each one on a golden platter. Use a for...of loop to print each fruit from the array.
Instructions:
Write a function printArrayElements(arr) that prints each element of an array using a for...of loop.
Example:
printArrayElements(["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]); // Output: Apple, Banana, Cherry -->

<!-- 
Task 3: Sum of Numbers (While Loop)
Story:
You’re a treasure hunter exploring an ancient cave. The cave has n golden coins scattered around. Use a while loop to calculate the total value of all the coins.
Instructions:
Write a function sumNumbersUpTo(n) that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using a while loop.
Example:
sumNumbersUpTo(5); // Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) -->
<!-- Task 4: Repeat a String (Do...While Loop)
Story:
You’re a wizard casting a spell to create a magical shield. The spell requires you to repeat an incantation n times. Use a do...while loop to ensure the spell is cast correctly.
Instructions:
Write a function repeatString(str, n) that repeats a string n times using a do...while loop.
Example:
repeatString("Hello", 3); // Output: HelloHelloHello -->

<!-- Task 5: Iterate Over Object Properties (For...in Loop)
Story:
You’re a detective investigating a mysterious object. The object has hidden properties, and you need to uncover them using a for...in loop.
Instructions:
Write a function printObjectKeys(obj) that prints all the keys of an object using a for...in loop.
Example:
printObjectKeys({ name: "Alice", age: 25 }); // Output: name, age -->

Medium tasks
Task 1: Filter Odd Numbers (For Loop)
Story:
You’re a scientist analyzing a dataset of numbers. Your task is to filter out all the even numbers to focus on the odd ones. Use a for loop to achieve this.
Instructions:
Write a function filterOdds(numbers) that removes all even numbers from an array using a for loop.
Example:
filterOdds([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // Output: [1, 3, 5] -->


<!-- Task 2: Find Maximum Value (For...of Loop)
Story:
You’re a treasure hunter searching for the most valuable gem in a cave. The gems are stored in an array, and you need to find the one with the highest value. Use a for...of loop to solve this.
Instructions:
Write a function findMaxValue(numbers) that finds the maximum value in an array using a for...of loop.
Example:
findMaxValue([10, 20, 5, 30]); // Output: 30 -->



<!-- Task 3: Reverse a String (While Loop)
Story:
You’re a spy decoding a secret message. The message is encrypted in reverse, and you need to use a while loop to decode it.
Instructions:
Write a function reverseString(str) that reverses a string using a while loop.
Example:
reverseString("Hello"); // Output: olleH -->

<!-- 
Task 4: Validate User Input (Do...While Loop)
Story:
You’re a gatekeeper guarding a magical portal. The portal only opens if the user enters a number between 1 and 10. Use a do...while loop to keep asking until the user provides a valid input.
Instructions:
Write a function getValidInput() that repeatedly asks the user for a number between 1 and 10 using prompt(). The function should only stop when a valid input is given.
Example:
getValidInput(); // Keeps asking until a number between 1 and 10 is entered -->

<!-- 
Hard tasks
Task 1: FizzBuzz with a Twist
Story:
You’re a wizard participating in a magical tournament. The tournament rules are based on the FizzBuzz game, but with a twist! Use loops to print numbers from 1 to 50 with special rules.
Instructions:
Write a function fizzBuzzTwist() that prints numbers from 1 to 50 with the following rules:
If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
If the number contains the digit 3 (e.g., 13, 23), print "Almost Fizz".
Example:
fizzBuzzTwist(); // Output: 1, 2, Almost Fizz, 4, FizzBuzz, ..., 49, Buzz -->


<!-- Task 2: Nested Loops: Multiplication Table
Story:
You’re a math wizard creating a magical multiplication table for your spellbook. Use nested for loops to generate the table up to n.
Instructions:
Write a function printMultiplicationTable(n) that prints the multiplication table up to n using nested for loops.
Example:
printMultiplicationTable(5); // Output: 1x1=1, 1x2=2, ..., 5x5=25 -->

<!-- Task 3: Modify Array While Looping
Story:
You’re a time traveler fixing a corrupted timeline. The timeline is represented as an array with duplicate events. Use loops to remove duplicates and restore the timeline.
Instructions:
Write a function removeDuplicates(arr) that removes duplicate elements from an array while looping through it. Be careful not to skip elements!
